# Grandstaff/Петолиние

REST-based cross-platform application built in the MERN stack with React + MaterialUI shaping up the front-end, Node.js + Express.js and MongoDB for the back-end, written in JavaScript following the latest conventions (ES11). The app is extremely feature-rich and the UI utilizes the latest design principles and trends sporting a sleek and responsive look. The main concept is for it to be a hub for musicians and a place for them to find jobs in the form of listings - a sort of LinkedIn, but for the music industry. In addition to this core functionality the app also has an Explore page powered by a personalized algorithm, a Concerts page that has real-time video conferencing capabilities, instant messaging and notifications, integrations with social media like Facebook as well as a way for the artist to put his work on display and prove himself to potential clients and much more. The app is available both on the web as well as mobile, in the form of a downloadable PWA application on the Google Play store.
